### 📜 Description:
A simple portfolio website built on Kotlin.


### 🛠️ Tools Used:


### ✍️ Reflection:
I have leveraged on Kotlin React Wrapper. The challenge was to convert the React javascript logic into kotlin.

As I started off, I was unable to understand [kotlin.style API](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/tree/master/kotlin-styled) which use the same idea as CSS in JS. Eventually had to skim through what CSS in JS means. Made use of Kotlin Delegate properties when needed for adding style tags and content.

Deployment: Github Pages looks for the compiled resources in either in the root directory or in docs. The default generated output is located in /build/distribution and I had to either manually copy the compiled resources to the docs folder or had to make some script which does that. This is when I thought I could create a Gradle Task for it. The gradle file (generated by the IDE) was Kotlin based, which was convenient for me as all I could make use of Kotlin stdlib to help me as well.
