### 📜 Description:
A simple portfolio website built on Kotlin.


### 🛠️ Tools Used:


### ✍️ Reflection:
I have leveraged on Kotlin React Wrapper. The challenge was to convert the React javascript logic into kotlin.

As I started off, I was unable to understand [kotlin.style API](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/tree/master/kotlin-styled) which use the same idea as CSS in JS. Eventually had to skim through what CSS in JS means. Made use of Kotlin Delegate properties when needed for adding style tags and content.
