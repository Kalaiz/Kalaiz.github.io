### üìú Description:
A simple portfolio website built via Kotlin. The challenge is to write majority of HTML,CSS,JS code in Kotlin.


### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
- Kotlin React,CSS,Styled [Wrappers](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers)
- Kotlin: Delegate Properties, lambda functions,Standard Higher order functions, Class References
- Chrome: For Viewing and Debugging
- To convert transparent images to a certain color https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp


### ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection:
- I have leveraged on  the Wrappers to build this project. I tried to go Kotlin 100%, however,as far I have searched  HTML tags such as meta [does not](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/blob/4c757b59f94e92146e9686f6a0444fe28c1b1a93/kotlin-react-dom/src/main/kotlin/react/dom/ReactDOMTags.kt#L171) have all attributes; Example: [charset](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_meta_charset.asp). 

- As I started off, I was unable to understand [kotlin.style API](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/tree/master/kotlin-styled) which use the same idea as CSS in JS.Furthermore, the lack of documentation made it slightly tougher. Eventually had to skim through what CSS in JS means. Also, at times , I found my self referring to the underlying implementation (Wrapper API code) so to help me understand what I should be doing. 

- Deployment: Github Pages looks for the compiled resources in either in the root directory or in docs. The default generated output is located in /build/distribution and I had to either manually copy the compiled resources to the docs folder or had to make some script which does that. This is when I thought I could create a Gradle Task for it. The gradle file (generated by the IDE) was Kotlin based, which was convenient for me as all I could make use of Kotlin stdlib to help me as well.


- Debugging seem tougher in comparison to a standard program as I had to do [debug](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/javascript/debugging-kotlin-in-browser.html) the website on the Web Interface.
