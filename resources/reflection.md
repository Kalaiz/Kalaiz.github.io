## ✍️ Reflection

- I have leveraged on the Wrappers to build this project. I tried to go Kotlin 100%, however,as far as I have searched HTML tags such as meta [does not](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/blob/4c757b59f94e92146e9686f6a0444fe28c1b1a93/kotlin-react-dom/src/main/kotlin/react/dom/ReactDOMTags.kt#L171) have all attributes; Example: [`charset`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_meta_charset.asp). I overcame this by using [`put()`](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/tree/master/kotlin-styled#css-properties)

- As I started off, I was unable to understand [kotlin.styled API](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/tree/master/kotlin-styled) which uses the same idea as CSS in JS. Furthermore, the lack of documentation made it slightly tougher. Eventually I had to skim through what CSS in JS means and learned that CSS in JS is an approach to writing CSS via JS. Apart from it, at times, I found myself referring to the underlying implementation (Wrapper API code) so to help me understand what I should be doing. While doing so I got to know more on Kotlin delegate properties and lambda expressions.

- I learned and used CSS [Flexible Box Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) (flexbox) as they have powerful alignment capabilities.

- While building this website, I gave consideration to different sizes of the devices by using scalable units such as vmin,vw,vh,% etc and using Flexbox.

- Deployment: Github Pages looks for the compiled resources in either in the `root` directory or in `docs`. The default generated output is located in `/build/distribution` and I had to either manually copy the compiled resources to the `docs` folder or had to make some script which does that. This is when I thought I could create a Gradle `Task` for it. The gradle file (generated by the IDE) was Kotlin based, which was convenient for me as I could make use of Kotlin stdlib to help me.

- Debugging seemed different in comparison to debugging a standard program  on an IDE, as I had to [debug](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/javascript/debugging-kotlin-in-browser.html) the website on a Web Interface.

- I tried my best to follow seperation of concerns.

- In order to make the social media preview the most updated one, I made a python script which takes a screenshot of the website via Selenium. I made my Gradle script execute it everytime the project is being built.

- I have not leveraged much on React and have done majority of the implementation based on HTML and CSS (in Kotlin). This is due to the website not having complex functionalities such as handling states of components.
